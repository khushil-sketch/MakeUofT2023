# About our Project

This project is part of the 24h Makeuoft hackathon taking place at Myhal.
We are making a sound transmitter combined with a pre-made oximeter to detect 
HR and SpO2 that is aimed at aiding people that suffer with mental disorders.

The sound will be projected through a speaker connected to our Arduino board
at a certain frequency that is proven scientifically to calm down people suffering from disorders such as depression and anxiety.
